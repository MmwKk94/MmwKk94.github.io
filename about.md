Iâ€™m Jun Kong, a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Auburn University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xiaowen Gong](https://webhome.auburn.edu/~xzg0017/). Prior to this, I earned my Master of Arts in Statistics from Columbia University and my Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Mathematics from the University of Missouri-Columbia.

My research focuses on federated learning and decentralized optimization, areas that bridge the gap between data privacy and efficient large-scale machine learning. I am passionate about exploring how these technologies can be leveraged to advance the future of collaborative and secure computing.
